# Xcode Debugging


## The Debugging Process

1. Reproduce the problem
> if you cannot reproduce the problem, then you (probably) do not understand it.


2. Gather Debug Information
> Logs, program, state,...
> What is the value of a variable?
> What kind of error?(ex.EXC_BAD_ACCESS)
> What line of code caused the error?
> Which functions or methods led to the error?

3. Form a Hypothesis


4. Try a fix
> Maximize the information gained per fix!
